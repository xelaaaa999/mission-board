# 🚀 Mission Board  (Haven't fully commited to the name)
*A clean, modern platform for collaborative side-projects.*

Mission Board is a lightweight, modern workspace for organizing ideas, missions, user stories, and feedback.  

The goal is to create a platform with better clarity, deeper reasoning, and the ability for anyone to propose improvements.

This is an early version of the platform — starting with a polished, reusable **Mission Card component** that will become the backbone of the UI.


## 🎯 Vision

Mission Board aims to solve a real problem:


> Most side-projects die because founders build alone, without structured feedback or collaborators who understand the vision.

Mission Board will eventually provide:

- A space to **publish ideas**
- A public/private **Mission Feed**
- Structured feedback from anyone (not just the project owner)
- Proposal cards  
- Collaborative refinement  
- Lightweight voting based on reasoning, not popularity
